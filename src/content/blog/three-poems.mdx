Pardon Me

Pardon me, I am going to erase
the night. Pardon me, I am going
to awaken you immediately.

You told me something once,
after dinner, sitting on the curb—
though you know I don’t listen
very well at all. It must have been
that “maybe destruction
is its own artistic gesture”

and it makes me think
that my forgetting of you,
the setting of time by the wayside,
was burning a painting for warmth.

Daisy Cutters

They were calling the bombs daisy cutters.
Tarquinius Superbus knew his son would know
what it meant when the messenger lopped off
the poppies. What does it mean, then, when
we cut the daisies, remove jungle from jungle?

This is a language problem. I am silent when filled
with shame. I do not know what it means
when flowers of any kind are cut down before me.
I am disturbed by the disturbance of flowers.

When I say this is my hand, you must agree. This is
my hand. When I was young, things would be found.
Things that had fallen off the truck. When they were
found, I was shamed into silence. I am haunted by
language problems. The passive voice comes to me,

stands behind me in empty homes, dark streets,
whispers my name from the rafters of dark barns—
things happened, and I just happened to be there.
I am a daisy cutter, I fell from earth, I am innocent,
I remove jungle from jungle, flowers from stalks.

I am a flash of light, heat, sound in the passive voice.

Private Language

Do not listen to me; listen
to my interpreter. She says
what I mean to say, but don’t
ever say. She is a bad interpreter,

but she tells my stories better than
I tell them. “Tell them the one about
the Amish girls”: watching a car crash
from building to building to building,

reflection from the screen flickering
across the clear membranes of their eyes
“and how, later, I saw them churning
raw materials into butter”.

I told her to tell you about the lonely times,
and she told you about the lovely times.
I told her to tell you about my triumphs,
and she told you about my despair.

I told her to tell you that I am disciplined,
but hate myself, and she told you I am mad,
stretched thin by ego, and sleep between
eight and ten hours each night.

I was tired after burying the lead with the hatchet
and paid her nothing to write this poem.
