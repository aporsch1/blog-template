<h2>
	<em>Pardon Me</em>
</h2>

<p>
	Pardon me, I am going to erase
	<br />
	the night. Pardon me, I am going
	<br />
	to awaken you immediately.
</p>

<p>
	You told me something once,
	<br />
	after dinner, sitting on the curb—
	<br />
	though you know I don’t listen
	<br />
	very well at all. It must have been
	<br />
	that “maybe destruction
	<br />
	is its own artistic gesture”
</p>

<p>
	and it makes me think
	<br />
	that my forgetting of you,
	<br />
	the setting of time by the wayside,
	<br />
	was burning a painting for warmth.
</p>

<h2>
	<em>Daisy Cutters</em>
</h2>

<p>
	They were calling the bombs daisy cutters.
	<br />
	Tarquinius Superbus knew his son would know
	<br />
	what it meant when the messenger lopped off
	<br />
	the poppies. What does it mean, then, when
	<br />
	we cut the daisies, remove jungle from jungle?
</p>

<p>
	This is a language problem. I am silent when filled
	<br />
	with shame. I do not know what it means
	<br />
	when flowers of any kind are cut down before me.
	<br />I am disturbed by the disturbance of flowers.
</p>

<p>
	When I say this is my hand, you must agree. This is
	<br />
	my hand. When I was young, things would be found.
	<br />
	Things that had fallen off the truck. When they were
	<br />
	found, I was shamed into silence. I am haunted by
	<br />
	language problems. The passive voice comes to me,
</p>

<p>
	stands behind me in empty homes, dark streets,
	<br />
	whispers my name from the rafters of dark barns—
	<br />
	things happened, and I just happened to be there.
	<br />
	I am a daisy cutter, I fell from earth, I am innocent,
	<br />I remove jungle from jungle, flowers from stalks.
</p>

<p>I am a flash of light, heat, sound in the passive voice.</p>

<h2>
	<em>Private Language</em>
</h2>

<p>
	Do not listen to me; listen
	<br />
	to my interpreter. She says
	<br />
	what I mean to say, but don’t
	<br />
	ever say. She is a bad interpreter,
</p>

<p>
	but she tells my stories better than
	<br />
	I tell them. “Tell them the one about
	<br />
	the Amish girls”: watching a car crash
	<br />
	from building to building to building,
</p>

<p>
	reflection from the screen flickering
	<br />
	across the clear membranes of their eyes
	<br />
	“and how, later, I saw them churning
	<br />
	raw materials into butter”.
</p>

<p>
	I told her to tell you about the lonely times,
	<br />
	and she told you about the lovely times.
	<br />
	I told her to tell you about my triumphs,
	<br />
	and she told you about my despair.
</p>

<p>
	I told her to tell you that I am disciplined,
	<br />
	but hate myself, and she told you I am mad,
	<br />
	stretched thin by ego, and sleep between
	<br />
	eight and ten hours each night.
</p>

<p>
	I was tired after burying the lead with the hatchet
	<br />
	and paid her nothing to write this poem.
