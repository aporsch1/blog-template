title: Hiding Places
---

Hiding Places is an apt name. This is an album that peers into those spaces engineered away from the eyes of laws and institutions. The characters in billy woods' songs are thieves, bandits, mercenaries, are most likely uninsured. These are not the sorts of people you'd like to bring home with you—woods himself raps, "No man of the people, I wouldn't be caught dead with most of y'all /"Don't call me again' what I shoulda said when he called."Kenny Segal crafts interesting, sparse, beats for woods to sink into. Some beats are lush, invite you to settle in, kind of like a fire that some of woods' characters would sit around, and some are deliberately uncomfortable, forcing you away from the music and into the lyrics. Many of these songs are particularly interested in the war on terror and colonialism and how these relate to crime. 'spider hole' refers to the hiding place of Saddam Hussein, 'spongebob' tells the story from the perspective of small-time afghan criminals who are forced to flee during the US invasion of Tora Bora: "'it's only one god,' what we said in Tora Bora / 'The bombs was on us! The bombs was on us!' / Came back to God like, 'Muhfucka you promised!'"These characters are loathsome in so many ways, though in the case of 'steak knives,' very funny as well. But you can tell that these characters haven't chosen their lives. They've been forced into living in the seedy underbelly of society. The narrator of 'steak knives' is a self described thug, "I shoot you in the street, be home for breakfast," but is hyperaware of the vulnerability of his position on the street. The song opens with woods' laughing and telling the listener, "you don't want to be in fourth place man." This is a reference to the movie Glenngary Glen Ross which centers around a sales competition, "Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired," in which fourth place is an ominous, undefined, malady. woods' narrator also knows that "a bum" is "what you call an old thug," aware of his status as a future bum, but unable to change the course of his life. The songs are so clever, packed with double entendres and a biting, terribly dry sense of humor. All this comes to an end with 'red dust,' the best, most terrifying song on the album. Segal comes in with a minimal, tension packed guitar loop with tinny, rattling drums while woods picks up steam. "I was in the ceiling when they swept the building / I kept my head down when the cops came for the children / I rode the train everyday past that fucking prison." 'red dust's narrator is filled with crippling guilt over what his life of crime has driven him to. He "breaks bread with killers and rapists" and though he might have moved on, somehow, he nearly yells "don't tell me that's the past / I live in the past jack!" He lived this life of despair, pain, violence and can't move on. He has an enemy, a list of enemies, but one he can think of in particular. He ends the album with this stunning, erotically violent verse.

> You on the list\
> Planet ain't big enough, we can't coexist\
> Say my prayers e'ry night you'll be in the mix\
> I can't wait, dream about it like sex\
> Etch you off the writ\
> Help you remember what you tryna forget \
> I want us to be alone in your home \
> I wanna suck the marrow out ya bones \
> I wanna show you what I learned from the worst people I ever known \
> I wanna follow you like the Jakes \
> I wanna swallow you, show you the hate inside, it's a lake\
> So cold, so deep I see you, you never saw me \
> Transferred to the C \
> So close, I can see a nick from shavin' \
> Your neck so exposed \
> Your throat would open like a hose \
> Eyes wide open, I would watch you go \
> Seeing you in hell, all I think about when they say woods, " That's all she wrote["](https://genius.com/16961380/Billy-woods-and-kenny-segal-red-dust/Thats-all-she-wrote) \
> I know the list long\
> I put you at the fuckin' top though

woods laughs and seeths for 11 songs and then unleashes himself on the twelfth. This is one of the most important rap songs I've ever heard and needs to be listened to for a real understanding. woods grew up between D.C and Zimbabwe, seeing abject povery and crime in Zimbabwe, but drawing parallels between government corruption and gun violence in both countries. His perspective is unique, biting, and demands to be listened to.
