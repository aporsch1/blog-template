## Overview

_10:04_ is essentially impossible to describe simply, in terms of what it is. At its core it is 'autofiction' which most people will then link back to Knausgaard or Cusk, but this, I would argue, is significantly different. Knausgaard is obsessive in detailing his life in My Struggle, literally including shopping lists and other sorts of ephemera, where is Lerner is nearly using parataxis on the large scale: using vignettes, each short to moderate in length and seemingly unrelated, in order to tell a greater picture. Lerner is also different from Cusk, because where Cusk's narrator exhibits almost no personality and acts more as a device to elicit confessions from others, Lerner's narrator is the main act. He is a poet and his observations are in turns devastatingly thoughtful and laugh-out-loud funny. Similar to Knausgaard, he is vulnerable, willing to tell you about some of the most embarrassing thoughts and actions, but he is never self-flagellating. This autofiction, like many other novels, tells the story of a writer who is working on a novel. He has just received an advance based on a short story, but needs to extend it while he is anxious about a possible heart defect, multiple hurricanes, an artists residency in Texas, and personal relationships.

## Sincerity

> 'I'll project myself into several futures simultaneously,' I should have said, 'a minor tremor in my hand; I'll work my way from irony to sincerity in the sinking city, a would-be Whitman of the vulnerable grid'

Many, like Daniel at Post Sincerity, would argue that *10:04* belongs with the New Sincerity, and I would agree. The book is never very explicitly political, but is very explicitly involved with the poetry and philosophy of Walt Whitman, who was very political, and there is a consistent undercurrent of climate anxiety with the book being bookended by hurricanes making their way up to New York City as well as the quiet bubbling of the Occupy movement.You can understand and enjoy _10:04_ without having read his previous novel, *Leaving the Atocha Station*, but since he considers them the first two books in a trilogy (with the last novel being *The Topeka School*) it helps to have read it or understand a bit about it. *Atocha Station* tells the story of a young poet abroad on a Fulbright in Spain. This poet (called Adam Gordon, but clearly a fictionalized version of Lerner) feels like a complete poser and blames a lot of it on his lack of fluency in Spanish, but it boils down to a crippling self-awareness, really self obsession, and an inability to really share his thoughts for fear that he will be exposed as being stupid or a fraud. He uses irony and sarcasm as a crutch and many of his interactions are soaked in that frustration and irony. By the way, this book is not angry, or anything like that, it is hysterical and I highly recommend it. *10:04* starts probably 10 years after *Atocha Station* ended and the narrator is much more grown up and less immature. But he is probably too self-aware and does rely too much on irony, which is why he says he "should have said" that he would move from "irony to sincerity."

Much of the book is dealing with these transitions. The largest, overarching transition is from irony to sincerity, Lerner tells this to us in the first handful of pages, but we also transition through relationships, from health to illness, injury, even death. Much of the time these transitions are made implicit, leaving you to draw the connections yourself, but sometimes Lerner can't help but blend things together before you.

> Despite the bright hospital lighting, emerging onto the street felt like crossing from the night into day, or from a darkened theater, a matinee, into sunlight, or, I imagined, like surfacing in a submarine—the threshold between the hospital and its outside was like a threshold between worlds, between media. Have you ever seen people pause in revolving doors like divers decompressing, transitioning slowly so as to prevent nitrogen bubbles from forming in the blood \[…]

## Proprioception

Octopuses are mentioned in the opening paragraph of the book as both the narrator and his agent eat them for dinner. An octopus becomes a leitmotif throughout the book; it "has poor proprioception, the brain unable to determine the position of its body in the current," storms take the shape of octopuses, and octopuses are painted on the walls of the children's wing of the hospital where Lerner is checked out (very humorously!). The octopus is a leitmotif, but proprioception is sneakily the motivating concept that motivates the novel.

Each vignette, narrated by who we see as the same narrator, is actually narrated by one of the 'projections' of our narrator, as he imagines himself in the future, moving from irony to sincerity. This, ahead of its time, creates a sort of multiverse of Ben Lerners. This generates an implicit metaphor of a sort of proprioception through time rather than space. In a fixed time Ben Lerner can feel ghostly versions of himself living slightly different lives, offshoots of unmade decisions. Radically, though, instead of considering them different versions of himself, like in most of the newer 'multiverse' movies, Lerner considers all of these Lerners to be him. They are limbs, swinging through four dimensional space. This book is the high dimensional image of these limbs whipping through this incomprehensible world. This sounds technical and weird and way too self indulgent, but it's also so moving and exciting and full of love. He remembers seeing a beautiful girl at some professors' cocktail party, realizing she is the daughter of the two professors and falling instantly in love with her.

> I had an overwhelming sense of the world's possibility and plenitude; the massive luminous spheres burned above me without irony; the streetlights were haloed and I could make out the bright, crustal highlands of the moon, the far sprinkled systems; I was going to read everything and invent a new prosody and successfully court the progeny of the vanguard doyens if it killed me; my mind and body were as a fading coal awakened to transitory brightness by her breath when she'd brushed her lips against me; the earth was beautiful beyond all change.

Except that he later finds out that this girl is not the daughter of his professors, but some mysterious woman who happened to be there unbeknownst to his professors. The narrator is crushed. You are crushed, too! Except in a later vignette, the narrator lets it slip that he married this woman and gives her the name of Ben Lerner's actual wife. This moment, later on in the novel is tongue-in-cheek and beautiful and made me laugh. People like Sally Rooney write books (very well) that make you think of love as a life or death struggle that can bring immense beauty, but one that brings commensurate pain as well. Lerner manages to convey that same rollercoaster of emotions sincerely, while also acknowledging how silly it all can be. In one life it works out, in one life it doesn't, in either case we live onward, thrashing into the unknown, only to laugh at ourselves later.

## Death

This is a dramatic subheading, but it's impossible not to talk about. I think that Lerner talks about dealing with death— the possibility of it coming for yourself and the reality of it coming to others—better than many other authors. From the beginning of the novel, the narrator is incredibly anxious about a dilation in a valve in his heart. It could be genetic, Marfan, or it could just be a probabilistic oddity. In any case, he thinks about something in his heart bursting, all the time, in one paragraph describing a day dream in which a valve pops open spraying blood all over the inside of his chest cavity—a description that should be gross, but is so funny you almost want to read it twice. He tells and ruminates over a story regarding his grandmother's death that was told to him by his father while his best friend's mother is dying of cancer. In each section of the book someone is dead, dying, or at risk of death. People seem to be thinking about the end, a lot. It turns out things never really end, sure, people die, but like Lerner's grandmother, characters keep telling stories and having good laughs.

## Knowledge

Lerner constantly plays with identity and knowledge. He loves people who are so sure of something, so sure of themselves, only to find that they knew far less than they imagined. In his vignettes you'll see an ex-girlfriend who faked cancer by pulling her hair out and starving herself; a woman who defined herself by her Arab-ness and then finds out she was adopted by the Lebanese man she thought her father; the narrator's on and off partner starts a strange galley of art that was written off by insurance companies; a man attending his girlfriend's father's funeral while grieving his own mother secretly. In each of these stories, all mostly fractions of the actual vignettes, you see people who are shocked by the truth after living with lies, the man who realizes his girlfriend is healthy, the woman who realizes she's not of Arab descent after all, the girlfriend who realizes her boyfriend's mother has died and he didn't have the heart to tell her, Lerner himself who realizes that the girl who is consuming his thoughts is not who he thought she was, etc. So often, we think we know things, only to have knowledge transform itself in front of us. In the face of major events or news, Lerner describes instant coffee looking different, full of life before a massive storm, only to return to normalcy after the storm, or the bathroom of a retail store looking completely different after hearing terrible news on the phone. The world is consistently rearranging itself before us, and in the 21st century these rearrangements happen faster and faster.

_10:04_ gets looked at as one of the last pieces in the new sincerity. It was published midway through Obama's second term, and was being written during the highest point of Obama's presidency. It gets written off as Obamacore literature, something too positive, too hopeful, not aware enough of the coming future. It's far more than that though. At one point the narrator grapples with the fundamental problem with Whitman: that he was in the middle of the greatest divides ever seen in America, the civil war, and couldn't take a side because it would demolish his universalist appeal. Lerner takes a side, but, like Whitman, calls out to you, and his past self, and says "I know it's hard to understand / I am with you, and I know how it is." This tackles the future and our senses of irony, dourness, and hysteria without preaching. This is probably my favorite book of the 21st century and I recommend it to almost everyone.
