## In Short

A Naked Singularity is the debut novel by Sergio de la Pava, who still works as a lawyer. This book is delightfully overstuffed. Conversations and digressions on boxing, television, the American justice system, perfection, and heists abound. It's a must read. If you only want to hear about the book itself, skip to the bottom.

## E Unibus Pluram and A Naked Singularity

In David Foster Wallace's seminal essay "E Unibus Pluram"—out of one, many: a play on our national motto, illuminating our atomization—DFW's thesis is that "irony, poker faced silence, and fear of ridicule are distinctive of those features of contemporary U.S. culture that enjoy any significant relation to the television whose weird pretty hand has my generation by the throat." He continues on to say that "irony and ridicule are entertaining and effective, and that at the same time they are agents of a great despair and stasis."

His argument is that the average American, at the time of his writing, was watching television for six hours per day. They focus on that one screen, the piece of furniture, for more than they do anything besides sleep. How can we remain unaltered after this amount of time? Television became the dominant form of culture dissemination and advertising and the world changed. When it happened, a lot of people didn't like this change, a lot of people still feel disgusted by television. What DFW argues, though, is that these artists, specifically writers, who try to lampoon and criticize television, only implicate themselves in the "jeering, surfacey" product that television produces. He calls these writers the 'new Imagists' (from image-fiction, another term for the sort of postmodern milieu that has permeated fiction for the last two generations). He argues that television beat the new-Imagists to the punch, that television is always absorbing, ironizing, and "re-presenting the same cynical postmodern aesthetic" itself and thus creating the sort of image fiction that was previously a countercultural element.

Now we are left to make an obvious step. How have things changed since 1991? Well, we no longer only watch tv at home, and tv is no longer the only way we are bombarded by this ironized, beautified, cynical aesthetic. We have small glass devices that carry this aesthetic and inject it into us for hours every day in addition to the time we spend watching television.

I'll spare you more critical analysis; I can't write any of it as well as Wallace, but it's important to recall his arguments. He essentially finds this new-imagist culture nearly indistinguishable from television and says that the new literary rebels will be "some weird bunch of anti-rebels, born oglers who dare somehow to back away from the ironic watching, who have the childish gall actually to endorse and instantiate single-entendre principles."

This is what the New Sincerity is all about. Some people believe the movement died, or at least flamed out as a serious movement at least a decade ago, like [Daniel at Post-Sincerity](https://open.substack.com/pub/postsincerity/p/what-was-the-new-sincerity?r=1igyab&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web), but I think it did some good as a movement, regardless of its current status. I read a lot, inevitably I read things that have that empty, ironic feeling—it often makes me laugh!—but nothing will make you feel better after reading than something that carries significant emotional truth. You can get that in Dostoevsky or, if you want something more current, in the New Sincerity—most of the time at least. The problem, though, with literature having sincerity as its sole predicate, is that it can be completely insufferable. Sincerity needs to be a vessel to carry value through. If it's the primary element, things become masturbatory, talking just to fill the silence, a non-stop confessional—annoying and tiring. But when executed well, it's fresh and fun.

## A Naked Singularity

Casi is a public defender in New York City. He lives in an apartment with Columbia grad students. He's in crippling debt and is consistently stressed about it. He is a first generation American with parents from Colombia. He tries to settle all his cases as fast and fairly as he can, but when he's had to go to trial, he's never lost.

Besides this, you don't need to know much about Casi. He lives in a fast moving, overwhelming world. He has too many clients, they live sometimes comic, sometimes tragic lives. They each have a different story and different way of speaking, and de la Pava delights in their differences and helps you to delight in them, too. The man who is booked for getting in physical altercation in defense of his new chess opening—it's a king and rook pawn opening. Casi first asks about the slowness of piece development before he continues on with the relevant case details—his undocumented cousin, arrested for selling hotdogs out of a hotdog shaped car without a license to sell food, and multiple other clients, each with an individual and equally funny or sad story to tell.

The New York City that Casi lives in is being shaped by 'Video Vigilantes,' people who are working with the police by surveilling as much of the city as they can, by uncommonly cruel weather—icy cold days and big storms, high profile cases around drugs and kidnappings. He works too much. He's so tired, but he signs up to work pro-bono for death row inmates in Alabama. One particular sequence that deals with this arc is particularly moving, and is possibly more moving and charged than all of Bryan Stevenson's Just Mercy. Sergio de la Pava has an intimate knowledge of this world and he puts it to good use. You are completely absorbed into his life as a lawyer. I left this novel with a much greater understanding of the criminal-justice process and the life of a public defender.

Casi's coworkers speak an unbelievable, but incredibly pleasurable, dialect that is a mixture of regular language, legalese, and David Foster Wallace-isms. His roommates are experts at shooting-the-shit in a way that so many smart young people are. Nerdy college students will recognize the sorts of late-night dorm room conversations that come up in the delightfully stylized voices of de la Pava. Some particularly funny, and at times dreamlike, sequences involve one roommate's hypothesis—and obsession—about television and the show The Honeymooners in particular.

A Naked Singularity is frenzied. It flips from topic to topic, characters speak over each other, each one unable to wait for the next to speak. Characters speak in intensely stylized, comic banter. This is unmistakably a work of hysterical realism as well as, I would argue, the New Sincerity. The book is stuffed with comedy, melancholy, sincerity, a heist, and incredibly enjoyable, necessary commentary.

If you enjoyed books like A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius or books like Infinite Jest this is for you. And if you didn't: this book is still probably for you. It's on the longer side, with over 700 pages of reading, but it blurs by and is varied enough that the time passes quickly.

For those who stay, there is fun everywhere. It's funny, but doesn't make fun of anyone, really. It's unabashedly sentimental and at times almost too sweet. [Brendan Driscoll's complaint](https://www.bookcritics.org/2016/02/03/second-thoughts-brendan-driscoll-on-a-naked-singularity/) about the book is that it felt needy. Sergio de la Pava puts himself into the book and essentially tells you, "look at me! this is who I am!" In this book, through Casi, he reveals genuine pain, laughter, sadness, real joy, fear, and raw love in and for all sorts of people. Driscoll is completely fair in his analysis and I would encourage everyone to read his review. David Foster Wallace did say, though, that this next generation of literary rebels would be those who would "risk accusations of sentimentality, melodrama. Of overcredulity. Of softness." Sergio de la Pava took the risks. He is a rebel. He's written a beautiful, sensitive novel—in a hard world, is this not resistance?—and still finds it inside himself to laugh! A Naked Singularity is not only a top-notch book, but an attempt at laying out how best to move through this world. Maybe the biggest question is, how do we have fun while escaping cruelty: both our own cruelty and cruelty inflicted on us? His novel is a pleasure and deserves to remain unforgotten.
