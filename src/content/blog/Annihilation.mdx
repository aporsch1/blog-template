> There is a limit to thinking about even a small piece of something monumental. You still see the shadow of the whole rearing up behind you, and you become lost in your thoughts in part from the panic of realizing the size of the imagined leviathan.

People will point out—for good reason—that Jeff VanderMeer writes weird books. Hardboiled detective novels in a world where half the people are living, walking, talking mushrooms, Orpheus and Eurydice's story in a twisted future with cyborgs and DNA splicing, among other things.

Annihilation could be considered a weird book. But it's written so cleanly, observed so sharply that it never feels weird. No artifice is detected. In this way, the book is not unlike its subject, 'Area X,' an area of land surrounded by a kind of bubble, in which the natural has claimed victory over the artificial. The land has been wiped clean of any human influence, and every time humans enter Area X to investigate, horrible, unexplainable things happen. The human explorers have committed mass suicide, turned on each other, or, right before the book begins, the members of the twelfth crew turn up back at their own homes with their memories wiped and with devastating cancer.

An anthropologist, biologist, linguist, and psychologist are the members of the twelfth batch of explorers. This isn't much of a surprise...but the twelfth expedition into Area X goes awry in a variety of ways. We only see this from the perspective of the biologist, though, and she divulges information at her own pace. Forewarning: this pace is not always what the reader wants. As a reader, you always know she is holding *something *back, but she eventually tells you most of what you want to know.

This information includes facts about her past as a biologist, about her marriage (and specifically about how her husband ties into all this), about the psychologist who leads them. The book makes you seriously consider a mostly subterranean tower made of what seems like fungus, complicated hypnotic protocols, and flashbacks over starfish.

This can sound silly to describe, but it's important to reiterate how serious VanderMeer is about all this. This is not funny, this is not quirky, this is life or death. The mystery that powers this book is about what caused Area X. Did it happen naturally, did a foreign power incite it, or is there something supernatural involved? One character brings up the idea of the supernatural, but the idea is waved off, I think, in favor for a concept I like to think of as the 'hyper-natural.' A force from the earth, but one that is not readily understandable and actively tries to colonize humanity, not unlike how humanity colonizes the earth.

> The effect of this cannot be understood without being there. The beauty of it cannot be understood, either, and when you see beauty in desolation it changes something inside you. Desolation tries to colonize you.

The biologist is the perfect narrator for this story. She describes herself as a loner. She is married but spends most of her time away from her husband, frequently looking for animal life in abandoned parking lots. She loves to watch others, being a biologist seems to have been her destiny. She tells us that "observation had always meant more to \[her] than interaction." She describes going out to bars with her husband and his friends and thinking about being "able to appear sociable but still existing apart."

But she doesn't just watch.

> My sole gift or talent, I believe now, was that places could impress themselves upon me, and I could become a part of them, with ease.

In Area X you have to decide if you are going to remain apart, a voyeur, or sink into it and become, perhaps, less than human.

If you like science fiction, stories of exploration, or even just commentary on the earth and humanity, this is one to read.

VanderMeer draws our eyes to the ground, to the trees, keeps them away from the skies. Too often, sci-fi pulls us into the stars. This is an understandable habit; the heavens are filled with cold, beautiful, but uncaring, beauty. The idea of that beauty being home to other beings evokes strong feelings of both curiosity and fear. Annihilation takes on the task of evoking these same feelings in our own earth. How do we let ourselves forget that we know less about the bottom of the ocean than we do about the stars? So much of our earth is left unexplored, yet we don't let it fill us with the same wonder and horror as the stars.
