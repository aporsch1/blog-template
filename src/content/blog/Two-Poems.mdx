# In Any Case

I’m in my room, curled up against the faint heat <br />
of the radiator, while he sinks against my closet door <br />
on the opposite side of the room.

<p>
	He has open wounds and is looking across the room at me <br />
	and I am hoping I will look to him and say “I am with you <br />
	and know how it is” like I am Walt Whitman,
</p>

<p>
	but after lingering silence and faint laughs through thin walls <br />
	he asks if I’d watched El Clásico, sighs, and laughs briefly in disappointment. <br />
	Our pain is not transmissible, but maybe absorption is transcendence?
</p>

<p>
	We sit with it, in any case, and each other. We are two confused boys <br />
	whispering the alphabet, the latin names of our favorite plants, and <br />
	our biggest secrets
</p>

<p>
	to God and hoping he can synthesize <br />
	perfection and make for us <br />a world beyond imagination.

# Approximations

A sky, parading its most chaste beauty, above <br />
a supermarket parking lot. <br />
It hangs above us, slouched back into the corners <br />
of the pick-up truck bed, drinking cokes, while the easy <br />
curvature of our laughter draws the ire of some grizzled <br />
cashier, off duty. We thought he couldn’t see how our futures <br />
stretched before us, like the way you see <br />
corn wrap itself around the earth in late summer.

<p>
	At the cemetery, an inscription, “A well-read life <br />
	is a life well-lived,” you’re laughing when I ask if he’d mind <br />
	if I sat on his grave to read. The benches have no shade <br />
	whatsoever, and there is no place quieter, with such lush <br />
	focus—flowers too. I’ve been assured by the man himself that <br />
	I want to live life well. Would a good man not wish me to fill the emptiness <br />
	that is mid-day in adolescent paradise with the chatter of a fine book and perhaps <br />a fine friend,
	too?
</p>

<p>
	We lobbed small rocks over the fence of the tennis courts. <br />
	This is when I thought that gravity’s rainbow was the slow motion <br />
	void rupture of a ball-toss at the start of every exchange. <br />
	As it turns out, gravity’s rainbow is the map of our fear of death on the x-y plane. That morning,
	in any case, I could have told you that it would be no problem to approximate <br />
	it with a handful of polynomials and that I still hadn’t kissed anyone, and if I knew air wasn’t
	compressed between us anymore, I’d ask you to shift into reverse, slam on the gas <br />
	and point the bed toward the past. Now, instead, we busy ourselves with cacophonous sleep.
</p>
