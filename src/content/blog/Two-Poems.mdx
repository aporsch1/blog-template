# The Barn

    <p>
        The barn lists—-scoured, <br />
        broad-shouldered, its frame <br />
        creaks against its own heft. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        The weathered boards, faded red, <br />
        pressed straight, stand upright. <br />
        Save for the missing ones—gap <br />
        teeth in a beaten jaw. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        The beams are beginning to warp <br />
        under remembered weight. This hardy <br />
        structure once held horses, hay, <br />
        brushed lips, in dry, dust-lit silence. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Winter is stripping this barn. <br />
        A geometry of patience, endurance, <br />
        battered and engraved with wind and waiting. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Snow arrives, brief and forgetful, <br />
        blankets the roof in pure indifference. <br />
        Hazy light fractures across furrowed planks—- <br />
        this structure, patient witness. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        This land remembers what snow cannot: <br />
        every ache, every labor, every day, <br />
        the slow accumulation of years <br />
        breaking apart in dirt, in splinters. <br />
        In the quiet collapse of names. <br />
    </p>

# Index of Themes

    <p>
        Before we walked, she said <br />
        these poems would emphasize <br />
        their own materiality. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Poems about trees, <br />
        poems about fields, <br />
        poems about loving <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        what you love, while <br />
        the poems were also poems <br />
        about poems and authors. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        In Crum Woods I said <br />
        everything was textual. <br />
        I am a text, am immersed in text. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Before we walked, she said <br />
        to put these glass panes down, <br />
        to no longer look at reflections, <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        but to pay attention, like you would <br />
        pay attention to a lover. <br />
        Worshipfully. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        To pay attention you need <br />
        to be present and to inhabit yourself. <br />
        To emphasize your own materials. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a textual object and I write, <br />
        tearing words from myself. <br />
    </p>
