# Preface

Over Thanksgiving break I often watch a few Harry Potter movies with my sister (my favorite is the seventh movie, by the way. I know it's a hot take.) It's an action of retreat. The world is slowly becoming less hospitable, the warmth and light of summer are decaying, and it's time to re-consecrate the home as a warm and comfortable place. The feeling that watching these movies brings me, on an emotional level, is directly linked to the sensations of the dust erupting into space when I pull the box of sweaters out of the closet, the quiet minty steam of my herbal tea, and experiencing the turning leaves. I read a lot, but frequently I fall into comforting movies or tv shows during this period instead. My goal, this fall, was to create a list of books, movies, short stories, and albums that evoke autumn as a way to consciously cultivate this feeling and to avoid a reading slump, or a dip in the quality of art I experience.

I think literature is in a tough spot right now. I think a lot of work is cheap and not entirely emotionally resonant, but in the literary fiction community the people that used to dig deep and make interesting experimental fiction are getting more experimental and colder; also not emotionally resonant. The pool people can draw from for intellectually and emotionally stimulating work seems to be getting smaller. There are only a handful of authors I can think of that regularly bridge the gap between challenging and cozy, but it's possible to do. I also think that I've found a list of books that balance the warmth requisite for the season, and the spooky allure of halloween and early nightfall. A list that can bring you from the golden hours of September to the starkly empty trees of late November.

# Short Stories / Poems

- **'Little Expressionless Animals' - David Foster Wallace**

This is early DFW. He came out pretty close to fully formed though. This is possibly my favorite short story from him. It's sweet, sometimes a little sad, but, in the end, comforting. It's a love story, but also ostensibly about the greatest Jeopardy! run ever, an autistic child, and inter-gameshow host rivalries. It features a taste of the funniest dialogue that Wallace would go on to write, while also including some Tony Soprano-style therapy scenes with Alex Trebek. All this, though, is summed up by a redditor—"wittgenstein this david lynch that… babe it's about a lesbian who kicks ass at jeopardy." It's possible to go deep, there are philosophical ideas about logical atomization, huge surrealist gestures, but it's also just a love story. Take what you want!

- **'Barn Burning' - Murakami**

This is a slow burn (haha). The story is quietly written, dreamlike, just like his novels, but a bit more tightly written. It's about a guy whose crush comes back from vacation with a boyfriend. The boyfriend is *off*. The book is permeated with unease. Something is wrong, but what is it? The ending is slightly ambiguous and that's the fun part. If you read it with a friend, you'll have something to talk about.

- **'Story of Your Life' - Ted Chiang**

This is a legendary short story. If you like sci-fi, you've probably already read it. If not, this is a story about a linguist who is thrown into an interpreting gig with aliens. The story wonders how life would change if the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis were true—how might learning how aliens speak change the way we think? Learning the language changes her, but how? She narrates the story to her daughter (you), and it's in second person. It's formally daring, emotionally warm, and it's normal to cry at the end. A great story!

- **'John Wick is So Tired' - Kyra Wilder**

This is one of my favorite poems from the last few years. A reframing of a violent, brutal, character to a sensitive and romantic one. This poem completely changed the way I viewed the movies and I find the poem to be moving and beautiful, and now find the movies to be a complete spectacle, and moving in their own way, as well.

I want to tell you to / look at his feet when he runs / the way they turn so delicately in / the way they’re listing slightly, his black shoes / the heels of them / their heartbreaking glissade hush-hushing across the hotel tiles"

- **['Redshift' ](https://www.cgreview.org/magazine/redshift)- Rachel Lapides**

The author of this poem was in the same dorm as me during my freshman year of college. She is at the Iowa Writer's Workshop now and her writing is playful but emotional. This poem is a great one. Don't wait to read her until she is famous!

# Books

- **_The Logos_ - de Silva**

My full review is[ here](https://unbecoming.vercel.app/post/the-logos/), but, beyond that, this is just a really good book for autumn. As you begin to spend time indoors, this is a good book to get wrapped up in. As someone who loves to watch sports, he has this passage, which I think about every time someone mentions the fall.

What had just arrived, as fall was coming on, was football, which replaced the slow, methodical, procession of the top of a baseball inning with the nuclear-level incident of the drive, leather flashing in the outfield transmogrified now into a discrete and wholly deliberate series of car wrecks, something that none of the other American team sports could claim.

and

With basketball, it was just the opposite, all the jittery, continuous thrills it gave throughout its endless reversals, in the deepening chill of autumn.

This is meant to be enjoyed during 'the deepening chill of autumn', not unlike the beginning of the NBA season.

- **_So Much Blue_ - Percival Everett**

Another book about an artist, but much shorter than The Logos. A story told in three threads: a love affair in Paris, a pulse-pounding rescue mission in El Salvador, and the present day. All these stories center the same artist and they weave together to a perfect ending. Everett's dry, signature, voice is here in spades. Best enjoyed with mint herbal tea.

- **_The Maniac_ - Benjamin Labatut**

This is like Oppenheimer, but better. Starting with the creation of quantum theory, honing in on John von Neumann and his work on the atomic bomb, game theory, the computer, and the genesis of AI, and ending with the Go match between Lee Sedol and AlphaZero. This book cuts quickly, almost dizzyingly, between first person perspectives, populated by famous physicists, mathematicians, their partners, and other people of interest. There is a blackness, a serious darkness that roils and seeths inside the finely written prose. The characters display crippling paranoia, gasping fear, and it shows. It does everything that Oppenheimer did as a movie, but better (and Oppenheimer was probably my favorite movie of last year.) It's an incredible success of a novel that is more compelling than any show on Netflix and more emotionally visceral. If you love dark and cinamatic…read this. I read it in one sitting during my Thanksgiving break last year, and I'll probably do the same again.

- **_A Wave_ - John Ashbery**

Ashbery is known for being tough to crack. His poems are shifty, hard to tell who's talking and who's being talked to, but sometimes his words feel so cleanly drawn straight from the air—surely no human could have found those words?—that you just nod and let the words touch your emotions directly. These poems don't need to be understood in a classical sense. You stand before them like you would a Rothko or Twombly and experience them. These are some of Ashbery's best word-paintings. I'd invite you to stand before them, see what happens.

- **_The Last Samurai_- Helen DeWitt**

This is a story about family, in a sense, individuality, genius, grief. I laughed out loud multiple times but I also sobbed in my room once or twice. This is an all time great book, but is also a pleasurable experience all the way through. A woman, haunted by the lack of curiosity in the world, raises a genius, intending to make him a maximally curious autodidact. She does not tell him who his father is, ashamed at how uninteresting she finds him. Her son, now eleven, sets off to find a father he finds worthy to be a mentor. What follows is always unexpected, but always readable. Helen DeWitt wrote a book that could pass as a comedy, while also being emotionally raw and provoking deep emotional responses in me. A panel of writers did name it the [best book of the 21st century so far](https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/helen-dewitt-the-last-samurai.html)—an unloved classic. It has a delightful crispness to it; it goes through multiple seasons but is always in a spiritual autumn.

# Movies

- **_Columbus_ - Kogonada**

This is a comfort movie for me. One I lean on when it starts to get cold and my schoolwork starts to pile up. It's quiet, but beautiful. A story set in a nearly unknown architectural mecca in Indiana, where the daughter of a recovering meth addict meets the son of a famous architectural scholar. It's not a romance, it's kind of deeper than that. They walk all over this gorgeous city and get to know each other like only strangers can, until it's time to leave. Fantastic dialogue, beautiful scenery, a moving score, and the acting is great. It's not particularly dramatic or funny, it's soothing and contemplative.

**Cool aspect**: The city. It's its own character in the movie. The buildings define every scene. Whether it's static or dynamic, calm or panicked. In the cases it doesn't dictate, it makes for emotional juxtaposition between the characters and the setting.

- **_Arrival_- Villeneuve**

This is an adaptation of 'Story of Your Life,' by Ted Chiang, directed by Denis Villeneuve. The short story is fantastic and the movie makes only small, necessary, changes to adapt it. The movie is arguably better than the book, beautifully shot, well acted, and most importantly, takes movie sized images and ideas, and is able to make them feel intimate and warm.

**Cool aspect**: The set design is awesome. The alien ships are beautiful, but loom, and the interior is extremely well imagined. It was even cooler than I had imagined when reading the story.

- **_Fair Play_** **- Domont**

This one crackles like a fire. The most dramatic on this list, it depicts a relationship between two investment bankers in a relationship. They have to hide their relationship due to company policy in their cutthroat firm. This becomes harder when they get engaged and one of them is promoted to the boss of the other. Their relationship strains and fireworks ensue. One of the best movies of 2023.

**Cool aspect**: the color palate seems purposefully muted/earthy as to let Phoebe Dynevor's red hair burn, it plays well with her character and is visually very interesting.

- **_John Wick_** (1-4)

The John Wick movies are among the most violent of all time. Wick kills with whatever utensils he has on hand, often gruesomely. But he's not without a romantic streak. The movies are pulse-pounding, violent, action movies, but they are also just about a hurting guy who wants to take a break, but can't. "I want to tell you to wait and be here and look / at me and also at the way John Wick is leaning / into those people that he's stabbing / how he gets so close to them and just holds them for a second / how he's so tired but he knows he has to let them go"

**Cool aspect**: The choreography. As the series of movies goes on, the choreography gets more and more complex and the most recent movie essentially became a disorderly, violent, Russian ballet. It's beautifully done, but extremely physical. A triumph.

- **_Liberal Arts_ - Josh Radnor**

It's set at Wesleyan and is really just about a working guy who misses the freedom and happiness of being at college. Specifically his old liberal arts school. It's a really sweet movie, but definitely awkward at times, though completely in spirit of a liberal arts school. Being this sincere is bound to result in awkwardness, but it's lovable.

**Cool aspect**: Josh Radnor is just a great dude. He is the best part of this movie, which is good because he directed, wrote, and stars in the movie. He films it at his alma mater, and he's all in. He's impossible to hate.

# Albums

- ***Hiding Places* - billy woods**

This is a cornerstone album for abstract hip-hop and perfect for the season. It could be read as a set of vignettes, each with a person finding a 'hiding place,' hunkering down in the fall as to survive the winter. The songs vary tremendously, but they all carry woods' dry wit and phenomenal lyrics.

**Highlights**: All the songs are great, but I love the [Glengarry Glen Ross reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4PE2hSqVnk) in "steak knives" where he just says "you don't want to be in fourth place, man" and then giggles manically. Other highlight, "red dust." "red dust" is violent, scary, but veiled under the auspices of eroticism. You could listen to it and not even realize how terrifying it is. it's the one song woods has never performed. It's emotional, scary, and very real, all the way down.

- ***Slowdive* - Slowdive**

The reunion album from one of the shoegaze and dreampop greats. The guitar blend until you are surrounded, buffeted warmly by the swirl of guitars and then folded in are the ethereal voices of Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell. Every song is beautiful. There's not much else to say.

**Highlights**: Sugar for the Pill and Slomo are some all time favorite songs! Beautiful, haunting, joyful. They've got it all.

- C***rush Songs* - Karen O**

This is a set of stripped down songs by Karen O. They are short, simple love songs about what it's like to have a crush. As anyone could tell you, there are ups and downs to those often unrequited feelings, and the songs reflect all of that. Perfect songs to listen to on a walk as the leaves turn and you need some time alone.

**Highlights**: 'Ooo', 'Day Go By,' 'Body'—all three of these reflect the emotional highs and lows of life. Incredibly listenable and emotionally performed.

- ***Excuses for Travelers* - Mojave 3**

Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell, of Slowdive, formed an acoustic, country-inflected, outfit. This album is where they reached their peak. The songs are sweet, lilting, with lyrics that oscillate between the sweet and wistful, never fully regretful. They take the folk music of America and inflect it with their alternative English sensibilities. It was completely and unfairly panned by Pitchfork, but it deserves a second chance.

**Highlights**: 'In Love with a View,' 'My Life in Art', 'Got My Sunshine'

- ***Normal People (Original Score)* - Stephen Rennicks**

I have a thing for Ireland in the fall. This score is minimal, ambient almost, but is beautiful. Listening to this transforms your environment. It's mean to soundtrack your life. Everyday walks, to class, to eat, to home, become cinematic. You feel like you are feeling a light breeze and walking through dewy fields, or later on, experiencing the warm acerbic energy of Dublin for the first time, eyes wide open. You almost need a light jacket to listen to this. It's very pretty.

**Highlights**: 'Much Prettier Girls in School,' 'Opening Vox,' 'Funeral Dark'

- ***Familiars* - The Antlers**

This is not only lighter fare than the crushingly heavy Hospice, but also more richly adorned. The coldness and despair in Hospice turns to a more warmly articulated sound peppered with a horn section and blurry pianos. This is also the start of the newer drumming style that the band has been using, it's very chill but has a lot of personality. It's an Antlers album, it's going to be a little bit sad, but Silberman does it with dignity and hope this time around. A great fall listen.

**Highlights**: 'Revisited' (I cannot recommend this song enough), 'Hotel,' 'Intruders', 'Parade'
