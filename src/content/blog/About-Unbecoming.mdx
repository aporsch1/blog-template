## What is this?

I'm interested in the idea of becoming. Not with an end goal, but the singular process of progress being the goal itself. In *The Last Samurai*, by Helen DeWitt, Ludo remarks that "it is literally untrue to suggest that peace, contentment, happiness follows a single battle, no matter how important, and that a hero who becomes is tantamount to a villain." This is a reminder that no goal will never bring lifelong peace or happiness, and we can further understand that no finite grouping of goals will ever actually satisfy us. Our sole satisfaction comes through continually becoming, while never actually becoming any one thing at all.

David Foster Wallace similarly said that it's "no wonder we cannot appreciate the really central Kafka joke: that the horrific struggle to establish a human self results in a self whose humanity is inseparable from the horrific struggle. That our endless and impossible journey home is in fact our home."

This journey home, our home, is a lonely one. The process of becoming is a violent one, ritually breaking and rebuilding ourselves. It's a grisly process, reconstruction, but a beautiful one. The 'horrific struggle' of reconstruction leads people to avoid the process entirely, stalling out—I have done this myself, for large periods of my life—as well as hide the most horrifying parts of their travel forward. This hiding, too often takes place through the cloaking of irony or simply silence. This makes everyone feel lonelier than they did before.

This brings me to my mission statement, my core belief, that art is a solution to this problem. Experiencing it—going to galleries, reading books, listening to music, sitting in theaters—and making it, opening ourselves up to others (and to ourselves) and participating in the act of creation. Art is a projection of the human experience and when done well makes you feel seen, accompanied in becoming. Talking about art, too, is one of the best ways to understand others and better understand ourselves. I feel confident that pieces of art have changed me, mostly for the better, and I love talking about it with other people.

My interests are mainly in literary fiction, indie rock, hip-hop, electronic music, pop-movements, movies, with a healthy interest in classic and contemporary art. In terms of fiction, I have a special interest in books considered part of The New Sincerity, an unofficial literary movement that shrugs off some of the ironic and sarcastic tendencies of modern life and embraces a necessary, but not necessarily uncool, level of cringiness, but I read a little (or a lot) of everything.

## Who am I?

I'm Abe, a math student at Swarthmore College. I grew up in rural New York, where I learned to love walking, playing tennis, and spending plenty of time reading.
