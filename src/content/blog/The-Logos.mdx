> 'I don't even want the logos. Let's go all the way.' 'To the logos' He turned his gaze toward me uncertainly. 'The Great Ideas.'

*The Logos* is undoubtedly a big book, but that's not entirely uncommon. What's uncommon, though, is both its quality (it's incredible) and its structure. By its structure, I mean its framing and narration are unique, specifically for a book of this size, because there are no interesting framing devices and the narration is a limited first person. Writing this, I can already hear people asking how they are supposed to drag themselves through over 1000 pages of the same guy's voice in a fully linear fashion.

> Sight could present too many things indifferently, fracturing the world into near-autonomous shards, leading you toward an inchoate literalness that defeated the prime function of the organ of vision, which was to track the consistency of objects through time and space.

Fear not, it took no dragging at all. In fact, from the moment I started it until the moment I finished it, I only thought about this book. When my eyes were tired, I was out for dinner with friends or family, in the gym, or whatever, I was either thinking about this book. Everyone I know had to suffer through discussion of it. It's been over a month since my reading it and I think about it every day. I can't give any higher praise. If I were to submit a ballot of 10 books from the 21st century, so far, for the much discussed [New York Times list](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/books/best-books-21st-century.html), this would almost surely be on it.

I've discussed A Naked Singularity and its rejection of modern cynicism through a boundless enthusiasm; the continuation of the New Sincerity. _The Logos_ similarly breaks away from this new-Imagist movement, the continuation of the postmodernists and the second-wave modernists, by creating an old school social novel. Maybe even a (groan) New York Novel. Unlike many other large tomes published today, that garner high praise (Markley's _Deluge,_ for example), this is not some cold hearted satire, but it's also not schmalzy—never exhibiting sincerity for the sake of it. There is a coolness to this, yes, but it is completely without irony. Completely straight faced. The coolness comes from the positioning of the artist. As a reader, you never quite understand how fully he is letting you see him. Is he leaving any of himself out of the picture?

> I didn't think the mind always had to be ramified through the body, that one should always seek the greatest possible transparency. Actually it was one of the most interesting features of being—that it could hide in the shadows, that you could miss it, and that that could be just right.

*The Logos* is viewed through the lens of an unnamed artist who, as you find out in the opening pages, has just broken up with a long time girlfriend who, importantly, was the subject of his only income—his paintings of her. The book opens with a daring sequence, one I can't help but grin describing—a 100 page long section in where there is no dialogue, just the thoughts of the artist. In this period he describes his ex-girlfriend and subject, gives a short history of art, talks about watching live sports, starts to paint one of his walls, discusses his proclivity for books, and prepares for an important meeting with his biggest buyer.

This meeting kicks the book into high gear, moving from seemingly plotless to intricately plotted. His rich benefactor tells him that a much wealthier friend of his, James Garrett, took an interest in his paintings and may have a job for him. The artist soon gets sucked into a Medici-esque relationship with his new benefactor as they begin an avant-garde advertising campaign across New York. Through the artists eyes you visit art shows, experimental dance performances, NFL games, penthouses, grimy bars and michelin starred restaurants. The conversation is irresistible and the characters are fascinating.

As the book continues to fly forward, the artist is given two subjects to work with for his advertising campaign: an odd, but magnetic actress, Daphne, and an incredibly intelligent, independent, but violent football player, Duke. The artist and his subjects function like moons, orbiting around James Garrett. Their perpetual motion is the engine of the book. Each of them have layers for the artist to peel back, new art to be made. Daphne and Duke have so much talent, and time to develop. The artist involves himself in their rise to the top.

The following quote is illustrative of the engine for this ad campaign, and why it is of interest to me—specifically of interest to this blog.

> 'These two kids are both becoming—they aren’t anything yet. They’re going somewhere, I don’t quite know where; no-one does. Nothing about their futures is assured. But they—I just have this sense—they are American futures…'

I cut the quote off by a bit, I don't want to spoil anything, the book deserves to be explored and read—multiple times. But I will address a few more aspects of the book. Particularly, the complaint that the narrator is unlikable. A handful of reviews consider the main weakness of the book to be the unlikability of the artist. I agree that he can be callous, his thoughts are, at times, disagreeable. He is not the kind of person I would like to be. But, is this not the point of the novel? What Mark de Silva gives us, here, is a puzzle to work with, a cypher to explore. Also, what does it look like to illustrate American futures? As the book progresses is de Silva making an assertion on the future of our country? The situation around Duke and Daphne does become increasingly complicated, even chaotic, and a statement is surely being made.

We as readers are like oracles, in the cryptography sense. We read a novel and learn about ourselves through our response to that book. If we only read books in which the characters, particularly the narrators or protagonists, the ones we are supposed to sympathize with, share our beliefs or moral codes, we learn nothing interesting at all! We need big, wild thoughts to provoke a novel response in ourselves. Sometimes we need books like soul food, the ones that provide warmth and companionship. That's when you read Austen or Tolkien or any number of heartwarming books like theirs. _The Logos_ will show you something and you'll watch with a grin. Every second is interesting and outrageous. The artist is commanding and smart, but obviously flawed, and as you read, he unfolds before you. de Silva has a dry, edgy sense of humor and you frequently won't know you're being toyed with until you hit the punchline.

The description of the book draws inevitable comparisons to The Recognitions by Gaddis, but it's important to remember that de Silva tells this story without a trace of irony. He intends for you to take the narrator seriously. I also believe that every decision made in the book is done with purpose. Why is the narrator left unnamed? I find this detail to be the key, in some way, to understanding things properly.

Our artist takes in the world and digests it, funnels it into his work—and funnels the world into you, the reader! He is our only set of eyes in de Silva's universe—and objectifies everything in front of him. Everything is part of the product. The eye doesn't see itself. Why would he have a name? He is his world, he is our world. Don't forget "the prime function of the organ of vision." This consistency of narration throughout a fractured world is a major factor.

In the exposition the artist discusses pop art. You hear how Warhol sucks all meaning and pushes it out to the surface, removes all depth from the paintings. He paints Warhol to be a figure who takes a look around, sees the world burning and thinks that if the world is ending, he might as well enjoy the show. Warhol takes pop-culture and lampoons it, lampoons it to the point that he might not be able to take his own art seriously, to paint with a straight face. Warhol sucks pop culture into the gallery, while the narrator is sick of galleries; he thinks they are stale. He asserts that the rich are the only people truly able to appreciate the best art, they are the only ones who can put the greatest paintings in their homes. Our artist believes that the only time that you can truly 'understand' a work of art is by living with it, consistently maintaining a dialogue with the piece. I would argue that _The Logos_ is a response to this. Instead of pulling art from the streets to the gallery, he blasts art from the gallery to the streets. This ad campaign projects his art across every borough and on skyscrapers.

This all raises an important question. Capital regularly consumes art; it mostly lives in the homes of the obscenely rich. As a response, art worked in the resistance of capital, revolutionary art. The question is about whether or not it's possible for art to work along with these channels of capital. That might seem rich coming from a small-audience, literary fiction book, but it's a question that's important and begs to be answered.

This book grapples with huge questions and it's so formally impressive how focused de Silva is all the way through. Not one sentence falls slack or feels uninspired. It's so hard to write a book this long without the jumpiness of Pynchon or the early adolescent excitement of DFW, but de Silva is able to channel a massive lexicon in a focused, taut flame, never feeling anything but in control, never at risk of burning out or losing control.

If I have one complaint about the book, is that it almost felt too short. That might sound unhinged, given the length of the book, but it felt like it stopped too suddenly. The quick ending fit well, but I just wanted to throw the book across the room. I couldn't believe that it was over. I wanted more time with it.

The lesson, though, is that once you finish, you can always go back. This book is meant to be lived with. Bring it with you and read it everywhere, treat it like one of the narrator's paintings. Let its light stream by the fixtures of your everyday life.
