> 'I don't even want the logos. Let's go all the way.' 'To the logos' He turned his gaze toward me uncertainly. 'The Great Ideas.'

The Logos is undoubtedly a big book, but that's not entirely uncommon. What's uncommon about it is both its quality (it's incredible) and its structure. By its structure, I mean its framing and narration are unique, specifically for a book of this size, because there is no interesting framing device and the narration is a limited first person. Writing this, I can already hear people asking how they are supposed to drag themselves through over 1000 pages of the same guy's voice in a fully linear fashion.

> Sight could present too many things indifferently, fracturing the world into near-autonomous shards, leading you toward an inchoate literalness that defeated the prime function of the organ of vision, which was to track the consistency of objects through time and space.

Fear not, it took no dragging at all. In fact, from the moment I started it until the moment I finished it, I only thought about this book. When my eyes were tired, I was out for dinner with friends or family, in the gym, or whatever, I was either thinking about this book or bringing up specific situations or ideas from the book for discussion. It's been over a month since my reading it and I think about it every day. I can't give a much higher appraisal than that. If I were to submit a ballot of 10 books from the 21st century, so far, for the much discussed [New York Times list](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/books/best-books-21st-century.html), this would almost surely be on it.

I've discussed A Naked Singularity and its rejection of modern cynicism through a boundless enthusiasm, the embrace of the New Sincerity.The Logosalso seems to publicly break away from this new-Imagist movement, the continuation of the postmodernists and the second-wave modernists, by creating an old school social novel. Maybe even a (groan) New York Novel. Unlike many other large tomes published today that garner high praise (Markley's *Deluge *for example), this is not some cold hearted satire, there is a coolness to this, yes, but it is completely without irony. Completely straight faced. The coolness comes from the positioning of the artist. As a reader, you never quite understand how fully he is letting you see him. Is he leaving any of himself out of the picture?

> I didn't think the mind always had to be ramified through the body, that one should always seek the greatest possible transparency. Actually it was one of the most interesting features of being—that it could hide in the shadows, that you could miss it, and that that could be just right.

The Logos is viewed through the lens of an unnamed artist who, as you find out in the opening pages, has just broken up with a long time girlfriend, who, importantly, was the subject for his only income—his paintings of her. The book opens with a daring sequence, one I can't help but grin thinking about—a 100 page long section in where there is no dialogue, just the thoughts of the artist. In this period he describes his ex-girlfriend and subject, gives a short history of art, talks about watching live sports, starts to paint one of his walls, and prepares for an important meeting with his biggest buyer.

This meeting kicks the book into high gear, moving from seemingly plotless to intricately plotted. His rich benefactor tells him that a much wealthier friend of his, James Garrett, took an interest in his paintings and may have a job for him. The artist soon gets sucked into a Medici-esque relationship with his new benefactor as they begin an avant-garde advertising campaign across New York. Through the artists eyes you visit art shows, experimental dance performances, NFL games, penthouses, grimy bars and michelin starred restaurants. The conversations are phenomenal, the characters are an incredible pleasure.

As the book continues to fly forward, the artist is giving two subjects to work with for his advertising campaign: an odd, but magnetic actress, and an incredibly intelligent and independent, but violent, football player. The artist and his subjects function like moons, orbiting around James Garrett, their motion is the engine of the book. All three of them have layers to unpack and think through.

The following quote is pretty illustrative of the engine for this ad campaign, and why it is of interest to me—specifically of interest to this blog.

> 'These two kids are both becoming—they aren’t anything yet. They’re going somewhere, I don’t quite know where; no-one does. Nothing about their futures is assured. But they—I just have this sense—they are American futures…'

I cut the quote off by a bit, I don't want to spoil anything, the book deserves to be explored and read—multiple times. But I will address a few more aspects of the book. Particularly, the complaint that the narrator is unlikable. A handful of reviews consider the main weakness of the book to be the unlikability of the artist. I agree that he can be callous, his thoughts are, at times, disagreeable. He is not the kind of person I would like to be. But, is this not the point of the novel? What Mark de Silva gives us, here, is a puzzle to work with, a cypher to explore.

We as readers are like oracles, in the cryptography sense. We read a novel and learn about ourselves through our response to that book. If we only read book in which the characters, particularly the narrators or protagonists, the ones we are supposed to sympathize with, follow our beliefs or moral codes, we learn nothing interesting at all! We need big, wild thoughts to provoke a novel response in ourselves. Sometimes we need books like soul food, the ones that provide warmth and companionship. That's when you read Austen or Tolkien or any number of heartwarming books like those. The Logoswill teach you something and you'll learn with a grin. Every second is interesting and outrageous. The artist is commanding and smart, but obviously flawed, and as you read, he unfolds before you.

If I have one complaint about the book, it's that it's too short. That might sound unhinged, given the length of the book, but I felt like it stopped too suddenly. This being said, the quick ending seems thematically in line with the rest of the book. It fits. I just wanted more time with it.
